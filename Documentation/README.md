## SANdbox Documentation 

SANdbox is currently intended to provide documentation, tools and helpful resources that will enable you to programatically interact with IP SANs.  Before you begin, please take a moment to review the following information:

If you intend to work with physical assets (Servers, Networking and Stroage) and will be configuring these resources for use in an actual physical datacenter, please refer to the - [SmartFabric Storage Software Deployment Guide](https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/t/smartfabric-storage-software-deployment-guide/)

If you would rather work with virtual assets (e.g., a virtual data center in AWS) and would like to follow step-by-step instructions to create such an environment, please refer to - [Let's play in an AWS based SANdbox!](https://brasstacksblog.typepad.com)

For additional information about NVMe IP-Based SANs, please refer to the following resources:
