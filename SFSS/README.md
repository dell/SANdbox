# SFSS - SmartFabric Storage Software
SFSS enables the automated discvoery of NVMe controllers that are available 
to each host within an NVMe IP-Based Storage Area Network (SAN). 

SFSS provides:
1. A Centralized Discovery Controller (CDC) as defined in the NVM Express(TM) 
Technical Propoposal TP8010.
2. An mDNS responder as defined in NVM Express Technical Propoposal TP8009.
3. A GUI that supports the configuration of zoning and discovery parameters.

If you're just looking for an overview of SFSS and see what it can do, Dell has provided
an [SFSS simulator](https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/product-demos/smartfabric-storage-software/index.htm?ref=DemoCenter__;!!NEt6yMaO-gk!WdfAXaGVUFFHMzL4v-Pj2BdinQaPpTkm1l6GZTc15AdXNgIWDPyAsi6FYuZEtJU$) that is available for you to experiment with.
