# Centralized Discovery Controller Implementations
A Centralized Discovery Controller (CDC) is an NVMe-oF Discovery Controller that supports NVM Express(TM) Technical Proposal (TP8010). 

## SmartFabric Storage Software (SFSS) 
SFSS is Dell's implementation of a CDC and is available for you to download and use for a limited time for trial purposes.

Other CDC implmentations may eventually be made available here as well.
