# SFSS - SmartFabric Storage Software

SFSS enables the automated discovery of NVMe controllers that are available to each host within an NVMe IP-Based Storage Area Network (SAN).

SFSS provides:

1. A Centralized Discovery Controller (CDC) as defined in the NVM Express(TM) Technical Propoposal TP8010.
2. An mDNS responder as defined in NVM Express Technical Propoposal TP8009.
3. A GUI that supports the configuration of zoning and discovery parameters.
