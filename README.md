## Astra
Astra is a developer enablement portal that provides documentation and tools that will help automate the deployment and management of NVMe(TM) IP-Based SANs (Storage Area Networks). An NVMe IP-Based SAN typically consists of Hosts, NVM Subsystems and one or more network switches that provide IP connectivity.

Dell SmartFabric Storage Software (SFSS) is Dell Technologies' implementation of a Centralized Discovery Controller (CDC) that allows administrators to deploy NVMe/TCP at scale. SFSS accomplishes this by providing a Centralized Discovery Service for NVMe/TCP Endpoints that facilitates endpoint discovery, registration, soft zoning, and event notification.
