## Astra
Astra is a developer enablement portal that provides documentation and tools that will help automate the deployment and management of NVMe(TM) IP-Based SANs (Storage Area Networks). An NVMe IP-Based SAN typically consists of Hosts, NVM Subsystems and one or more network switches that provide IP connectivity.

Dell SmartFabric Storage Software (SFSS) is Dell Technologies' implementation of a Centralized Discovery Controller (CDC) that allows administrators to deploy NVMe/TCP at scale. SFSS accomplishes this by providing a Centralized Discovery Service for NVMe/TCP Endpoints that facilitates endpoint discovery, registration, soft zoning, and event notification.

Astra provides documentation, tools and helpful resources that will enable you to programatically interact with IP SANs.  Before you begin, please take a moment to review the following information.
