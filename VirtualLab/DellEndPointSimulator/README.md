## Dell End Point Simulator 
The Dell End Point Simulator interacts with SFSS and simulates end devices (e.g., Hosts and Storage subsystems).  You can run the DellEndPointSimulator binary
on Linux Hosts (I've tested it on Ubuntu 20.04) and it will connect to the SFSS instance "In-Band" to perform registration.

The simulator supports Push registration (acting as a Host or Subsystem) as well as Pull registration (acting as a subsystem). More information can be found in
the simulator documentation.
